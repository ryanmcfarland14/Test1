Things I don’t have much experience with and would like to learn more about.
Additions that I think would be beneficial to my experience here at Travelers.

Goals

•	Leading Self
	Balance of listening and contributing in meetings
	Focus in on the details while understanding how the details fit into the big picture
	Practice self-awareness
	Continuously seek feedback
	Dive deep into topics and areas that interest me the most
	Take chances on new projects to learn and adapt as I go 
	Others?



•	Leading Process
	Deliver realistic and innovative proposals based on observations and experiences
	Gain insight into current processes to determine potential inefficiencies and then work to identify possible solutions, either individually or by soliciting the input of others
	Watch and learn from other leaders in the office, what are some of their techniques and approaches when dealing with other employees? What methods are most effective in the Information Technology department of business?
	Others?




•	Leading Others
	Have a positive impact on the portfolio team
	Maintain balance and calmness when presented with complex situations, projects, or relationships 
	Improve skills related to influencing peers and to having an impact in a peer setting (such as Innovation Showcase)
	Practice the ability to influence others by building on relationship management skills and by maintaining partnerships with various groups
	Sharpen skills related to critical thinking in order to determine the best course of action when presented with complex situations

	Be involved in the planning process to gain exposure in a wide variety of areas regarding information technology while simultaneously being an asset to the team.
	Others?



•	Leading Technology
	Gain understanding of the PI Production Services space
	Build upon skills of identifying gaps and inefficiencies in processes, then working to recover and advance those processes
	Communicate direction, updates, escalations, and the like to both technical and non-technical stakeholders when applicable
	Participate in technical conversations and develop confidence to ask the right questions
	Improve basic knowledge of tools, technologies, and applications being used at Travelers, specifically within PI but also considering enterprise-wide and Global Technology Systems (GTS)
	Become well versed in the W2K16 project to learn as much as I can about the Agile process throughout the internship experience.
	In my own time, develop an understanding of how Travelers has specifically designed a strategy for Agile compared to how other teams in the industry might do it.
•	For example, the agile point system is based off of a scale of hours. One point equates to one eight hour work day, half of which is designated to developing and the other half to testing.
•	Other areas for examination could be the structure of Epics, Features, & Stories, the length of the iterations, and/or how the team defines their capacity in velocity.
	Others?
